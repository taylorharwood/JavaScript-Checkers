**As a ___, I want ___, so that I can ___.**


**MVP**:
- As a user, I want to be able to move my pieces on the board, so I can try and win the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to pick my color at the start of the game.
- As a user, I want to have a tracker that shows how many pieces I have left and how many pieces my opponent has left, so I can gauge how I'm doing in my current game.
- As a user, I want a reset game button so that I can reset the game instead of frusturatingly playing through a game I know is a lost cause.
- As a user, I want a aesthetically pleasing and functional UI so that I can clearly see the status of the game.
